The assembly file "project1c" is a PIC Assembly program that will use a button and 8 LEDS as inputs and outputs.  
The LED’s will be used to display a continuous pattern sequence of your choosing.  
A sequence is defined as having gone through all of the LEDS.
The button will be used to advance through the sequence, i.e. off, pattern…..  
Subsequent button activations will alter the timing of the sequence. Off , Slow, Med, Fast,….back to Off.
